# INFEST
## Overview
INFEST for k**IN**ematic o**F** l**ES**ion developmen**T**. This plugin was used to compute the kinematic of lesion caused by the necrotrophic fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. INFEST was developed for QIP (quantitative immunity in plant) @ LIPM (Lab of plant microbes interaction) in Toulouse by Adelin Barbacci. Feel free to use it.

### command line :

infest.py path_containing_images start stop
- path_containing_images the full path of the directory containing pictures (e.g. /home/foo/bar/)
- start (optional, default 0) an integer corresponding to the first image to consider.
- stop (optional, default max(image_name)) an integer corresponding to the last image to consider.

### Examples
`infest.py /home/foo/bar/ 0 250`
`infest.py /home/foo/bar/ 0`
`infest.py /home/foo/bar/`


### To go further
To compute the growth rate associated to kinematic of lesion development we advice to use the 'segmented' R library after a log transform of the curve obtained with INFEST.
### Latest news
- Version 1 available

# Getting started
## Details
This version has been developed and tested under ubuntu 18.10 with python 2.7. The dependancies are:
- matplotlib==2.2.4
- numpy==1.16.5
- scikit-image==0.14.5

## Prerequists
Having python and conda install on your machine.
- For linux install please see: [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
- For other systems: [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/#system-requirements)
## Installation instructions
- Download the python sources:
- wget
Creation of a conda environment

`conda env create -n INFEST -f env_Infest.yml`

`conda activate INFEST`

`python infest.py path_to_picture`



# Tutorial
In this short tutorial we will use INFEST to compute the kinematic of lesion development of a single detached leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana coined 'Col-0_154'
![Col-0_154 leaf](https://github.com/A02l01/tuto/blob/master/data_tuto/pictures/grid_layout/panel.jpg)

Other kinematics can be computed by adding bounding boxes of leaves in the `grid_layout.layout` file.

## creation of the layout file
- creation of the grid_layout subdirectory in the picture directory. here creation of ./Image_tuto/pictures/grid_layout/
- creation of the grid_layout.layout file in ./Image_tuto/pictures/grid_layout/ directory. We used ImageJ to obtain the coordinates of the bounding rectangle. We add the single line

Col-0_154       1410    2574    1497    2721

to ./Image_tuto/pictures/grid_layout/grid_layout.Layout
with Col-0_154 the Id of the leaf, 1410 ymin of the rectangle, 2574 xmin of the rectangle, 1497 ymax of the rectangle, 2721 xmax of the rectangle. **Items are separeted by a tabulation**.



All data are in the data_tuto/ directory

## Prerequist
Name of images 1.jpg to N.jpg
Layout file grid_layout.layout in the directory
Layout file must is composed by 'name'<tab>'ymin','xmin','ymax','xmax'
## Command line prototype
infest.py path_containing_images start stop
